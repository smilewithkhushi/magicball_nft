# MagicBall_NFT
A hackathon project that combines the classic 8-ball game with the power of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).



## What is MagicBall_Nft?

Indeed, the 8 ball game is a simplistic application that generates responses based on a set of predetermined parameters. If the user find the generated response to their liking, they have the option to preserve it in the form of a Non-Fungible Token (NFT). The creation of said NFT involves the transformation of the response into an image, which is then minted to the user's wallet address for safekeeping. This affords the user the autonomy to add it to their personal profile, or to use it as they see fit.
